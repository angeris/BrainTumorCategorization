Directory to include data files. Everything from this directory is excluded by the gitignore and this is only used for bookkeping purposes (e.g. the data should be copied locally on each computer).

The specific datasets used in our project were those of the 2013 BraTS competitions, patient 1, though the code should work with any of the available datasets for any BraTS year.
